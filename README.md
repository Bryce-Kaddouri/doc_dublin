# What is Flutter ? 

Flutter is a mobile app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop like Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

---

# Why Flutter ? 

Flutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase. It’s fast, expressive, flexible, and reactive. Flutter also includes a rich set of fully-customizable widgets, along with APIs for 2D, animation, gestures, effects, and more.

So with Flutter you can build a native app for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This is a huge time saver  and money saver. Flutter allows you to focus on building your app instead of maintaining two separate codebases.

# 1 - Installation of Flutter
### A - Windows Installation

**1.** Requirements

In order to install Flutter on Windows, you have to install git 2.x and , if you already have it, you can skip this step. Else to install Git, yo can just download it with this link below: [Download Git](https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-release-asset-2e65be/23216272/9f52f8e4-769e-4307-88b1-eea7ab1f05ca?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20230123%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230123T154209Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=34ede7527cba1e982b9cc497d491b38b63f29f0da54f0dcd7cc3b0db692abd23&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=106662991&key_id=0&repo_id=23216272&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3DGit-2.39.1-64-bit.exe&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream
)
After you have downloaded it, execute the setup. When the installation is finished, open a new Windows Command Prompt and try to run the git command that allows you to know the version of git. 

---

**2.** Get the Flutter SDK

Download the Flutter SDK from the [Flutter SDK archive](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_2.5.3-stable.zip) and unzip it to the directory where you want to install Flutter (for example, `C:\src\flutter`).
Be sure to put the Flutter directory in a standard path (for example, in `C:\src`), not in a directory like `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads` that requires elevated privileges to access.

After that you have to add the Flutter tool to your path. Open the Windows Control Panel, type `path` in the search box, and select **Edit the system environment variables**. The **System Properties** window appears. Click **Environment Variables**. In the section **System**

---
**variables**, find the **Path** variable and select it. Click **Edit**. If the **Path** environment variable doesn't exist, click **New**.

Add the full path to the Flutter tool (`C:\src\flutter\bin`) using the semicolon character (`;`) as a separator from the existing values. Click **OK** to save the change. Close any open terminal windows so that the new environment variables can take effect.

To be sure that the Flutter tool is available in your terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
C:\> flutter --version
```
---
**3.** Confirm that your development environment is set up correctly

To confirm that your development environment is set up correctly, run the following command:

```bash
C:\> flutter doctor
```

```bash
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[√] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.5.3, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19043.1288], locale en-US)
[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 31.0.0)
[√] Chrome - develop for the web
[√] Android Studio (version 2020.3)
[√] VS Code (version 1.63.2)
[√] Connected device (2 available)

• No issues found!
```

---

**4.** resolve some issues found by the doctor command 

**A)** If you get the error message `Android license status unknown` when you run the flutter doctor command, run the following command to accept the Android SDK licenses:

```bash
C:\> flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

**B)** If you get the error message `Unable to locate Android SDK` when you run the flutter doctor command, run the following command to update the location of the Android SDK:

```bash
C:\> flutter config --android-sdk <path_to_android_sdk>
```

---

**5.** configure your IDE (Android Studio or VS Code)

**A)** Android Studio

1. Start Android Studio.
2. Select **Configure > Plugins** from the menu.
3. Select the **Marketplace** tab, search for Flutter, and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
4. Click **Yes** when you are prompted to install the Dart SDK.
5. Click **Restart** when prompted.

---

**B)** VS Code

1. Start VS Code.
2. Select **View > Command Palette** from the menu.
3. Select **Install Extensions**.
4. Search for Flutter and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
5. Click **Reload** when prompted.

The Flutter and Dart plugins provide code completion, along with visual and structural editing support, for Flutter development.

---

### B - Mac Os Installation

**1.** Requirements

In order to install Flutter on Mac Os, you have to install git 2.x and , if you already have it, you can skip this step. Else to install Xcode, because it includes the necessary command line tools and Git. You can download it from the Mac App Store.

After Xcode is installed, open a terminal window and run the following command to confirm that Xcode is installed correctly and that the `xcode-select` command line tool is functional:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

---

if you get the following message, you are ready to continue:

```bash
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" in System Settings to install updates
```
 That means Xcode is installed and the `xcode-select` command line tool is functional.

**2.** Get the Flutter SDK

 If you have an Intel Mac download the zip file of the SDK with this link : [Flutter SDK archive](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_3.3.10-stable.zip)   

If you have an Apple Silicon Mac download the zip file of the SDK with this link : [Flutter SDK archive](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_arm64_3.3.10-stable.zip)

---

When your download is finish extract the zip file in a folder which don't need elevated privileges and contains no spaces or special characters with this command : 
    
For Intel Mac : 

```bash
$ unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_3.3.10-stable.zip 
```

For Apple Silicon Mac : 

```bash
$ unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_arm64_3.3.10-stable.zip
```


---

After that, update your PATH in order to execute the flutter command. To do this you need to determine what shell you are using run the command  in your terminal window: 

```bash
$ echo $SHELL
```

For bash  shell create or edit the rc file by running this command :

```bash
$ nano $HOME/.bashrc
```

For Z shell create or edit the rc file with this following command :

```bash
$ nano $HOME/.zshrc
```

---

In this file paste this following line in your file : 

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/bin"
```

Now, change the flutter directory by the location of your flutter SDK. for example, My SDK’s location is “/Users/brycekaddouri/devflutter/flutter”, so I replace “PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY” by my SDK’s location and save your file.
In a new terminal window run the command to be sure flutter are correctly installed:
    
```bash
$ flutter doctor
```

---

make sure the licence agreement is signed by either opening Xcode by running the commande :

```bash
$ sudo xcodebuild -license
```
You can set up your editor like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio in the same way as on Windows.
